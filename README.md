# Full Clearzo Ruleset
Link to [Typo's Discord for Clearzo Discussion](https://discord.com/invite/jMBFB7TW)

**Full Clearzo** is an FireRed/LeafGreen Kaizo Ironmon variant where an additional rule is added: **all trainers in every dungeon must be defeated before leaving the dungeon**.

Otherwise, Full Clearzo is played using the standard [**Kaizo Ironmon** ruleset](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1#kaizo-ironmon-ruleset).

This increases difficulty and strategic risk, as it mandates full clears of dungeons that are typically partially routed or skipped, including areas such as **Rock Tunnel**, **Silph Co.**, and **Victory Road**, and forces additional risk in early-game dungeons.

## Technical DISCLAIMER
If your game is patched with the National Dex from the beginning (this is typically a randomizer setting), your Full Clearzo run will "break" at **Sevii Islands** and the built-in Elite Four rematch mechanics will trigger upon the first visit to the islands. There is no way to undo this.

## General Rules for Clearzo

0. Every Dungeon must be cleared, fully, upon entry.
1. **Pokémon Tower** in Lavender Town must be **full-cleared up to Marowak on the first entry**.
2. Victory Road must be full-cleared, as it is considered a Dungeon.
3. **The Sevii Islands are legal** and may be entered at any point before the Elite Four once you unlock them.  
   - The three islands (One, Two, Three) accessible before the Elite Four are treated as **one continuous dungeon**.
   - All trainers must be defeated with **no Pokémon Center or NPC heals** allowed during the clear.
   - You may utilize the Move Relearner once on this trip to Sevii, provided you have the necessary currency. This includes learning multiple moves.
4. After you defeat the Elite Four, your leaderboard position is determined from your **Victory Lap** on the remaining Sevii Islands (Four, Five, Six, Seven).
   - These islands are considered one continuous dungeon.
   - Pokémon Center and NPC heals are forbidden.
   - You may ultilize the Move Relearner once on this trip to Sevii.
   - This is a death march. You proceed until your Pokémon faints, tracking how many trainers you defeated at the time of demise.
5. Legendary Pokémon with exactly a **BST of 580** are legal as starter Pokémon.  
   - If a BST 580 Pokémon is taken from the starter table, **the chosen Pokémon must be ran unless otherwise disallowed due to other rules**.
   - If the Pokémon can be ran, you are not allowed to pivot. This includes Content (Diglett) Cave pivoting as well.
   - If the table **ONLY** has Pokémon over the 580 BST threshold, the base Kaizo rule of pivoting immediately (or trashing the seed) applies.

Good luck and **FCOD**! (full clear or die)
