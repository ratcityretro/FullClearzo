# Full Clearzo Ruleset
Link to [Typo's Discord for Clearzo Discussion](https://discord.gg/Q8zYpznW)

**Full Clearzo** is an FireRed/LeafGreen Kaizo Ironmon variant where an additional rule is added: **all trainers in every dungeon must be defeated before leaving the dungeon**.

Otherwise, Full Clearzo is played using the standard [**Kaizo Ironmon** ruleset](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1#kaizo-ironmon-ruleset).

This increases difficulty and strategic risk, as it mandates full clears of dungeons that are typically partially routed or skipped, including areas such as **Rock Tunnel**, **Silph Co.**, and **Victory Road**, and forces additional risk in early-game dungeons.

## Technical DISCLAIMER
If your game is patched with the National Dex from the beginning (this is typically a randomizer setting), your Full Clearzo run will "break" at **Sevii Islands** and the built-in Elite Four rematch mechanics will trigger upon the first visit to the islands. There is no way to undo this. [Dr. Maple's Faster FireRed](https://github.com/DrMaple/Faster-FireRed) has been proven to not interfere with late game Clearzo.

## General Rules for Clearzo

0. Every Dungeon must be cleared, fully, upon entry.
1. **Pokémon Tower** in Lavender Town must be **full-cleared up to Marowak on the first entry**.
2. Victory Road must be full-cleared, as it is considered a Dungeon.
3. **The Sevii Islands are legal** and **must** be entered at any point before the Elite Four once you unlock them.  
   - The three islands (One, Two, Three) accessible before the Elite Four are treated as **one continuous dungeon**.
   - All 26 available trainers must be defeated with **no Pokémon Center or NPC heals** allowed during the clear.
   - You may utilize the Move Relearner once on this trip to Sevii, provided you have the necessary currency. This includes learning multiple moves.
   - You make take the Full Restore after the 4 biker trainers.
   - You may keep the iapapa berry after the Hypno fight.
   - You may not take any other items.
4. After you defeat the Elite Four, your leaderboard position is determined from your **Victory Lap** on the remaining Sevii Islands (Four, Five, Six, Seven).
   - These islands are considered one continuous dungeon with 75+ trainers.
   - You may ultilize the Move Relearner once on this trip to Sevii.
   - Pokémon Center and NPC heals are forbidden.
   - You may not take any other items.
   - This is a death march. You proceed until your Pokémon faints, tracking how many trainers you defeated at the time of demise with the `!progress sevii` Tracker command.
5. Legendary Pokémon with exactly a **BST of 580** are legal as starter Pokémon.  
   - If a BST 580 Pokémon is taken from the starter table, **the chosen Pokémon must be ran unless otherwise disallowed due to other rules**.
   - If the Pokémon can be ran, you are not allowed to pivot. This includes Content (Diglett) Cave pivoting as well.
   - If the table **ONLY** has Pokémon over the 580 BST threshold, the base Kaizo rule of pivoting immediately (or trashing the seed) applies.

Good luck and **FCOD**! (full clear or die)
