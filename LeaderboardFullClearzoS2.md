# Full Clearzo Season 2 Bet

This is the tracking page for the **Full Clearzo** bet that will run from **February 1st, 2026** to **April 30th, 2026**.

Entry must be declared in [typo's Discord](https://discord.gg/Q8zYpznW), in the `#clearzo-gc` channel. You can select which bet you're participating in by reacting to the pinned message by **ratcityretro (rat)**.

**Deadline to declare entry:** February 28th, 2026

## The Bets

All participants are competing to achieve the **furthest valid clear** within the 1500 seeds they attempt during the Season 2 window. Progress is measure by furthest clear using the tracker command `!progress sevii` which will give you total out of 447 trainers and a percentage. Outcomes are determined per bet category as follows:

**Gift Subs Bet**  
Participants who do **not** hold the furthest clear among all submitted runs will be asked to **gift 25 Twitch subs to the victor**. Sub gifting will be coordinated for optimizing a colossal **Hype Train**, though participants may complete their obligation in multiple installments if necessary.

**Emote Bet**  
Participants who do **not** hold the furthest clear among all submitted runs will be required to **forfeit the use of one emote slot** to the victor for a period of **six (6) months**.  
The victor may choose the emote design and theme, provided it complies with standard **Twitch emote content policies**.

**Charity Opt-In**  
In lieu of the Subs Bet, the victor may elect to activate the **Charity Opt-In**. If chosen, participants who do **not** hold the furthest clear will instead **donate to a charity selected by the victor**, in an amount approximately equivalent to **$100 USD**. 
This option replaces sub gifting entirely for those participants and must be declared in advance like the other categories.
